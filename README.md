This project is seperated into 3 parts and its main purpose is to serve as a system to regulate event authorization for a generic country during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Authorization is stipulated by size of event and budget of the event promoter.

Part A of the project acts as base for part B and C where main classes are defined such as:

Venue and it's children classes- Generates a venue based off certain specifications by the user in which an event can take place

Ministry-It exposes one public method, namely checkApproval(), which has the following behaviour: int
         checkApproval(ApprovalRequest ar) assesses an approval request to see if an event should be
         held at a venue based on prevailing rules, and returns the id of the approval request if it is
         determined that the event should be held.

Promoter-The Promoter class represents an event organizer who conceptualizes an event and initiates the
         process of getting it approved.

Approval Request-Generates an approval request, and
                 assigns a reference to an Event and a Venue. It then assigns a unique consecutively
                 increasing id. The first id has value 0.

Date-The Date class, used to represent a date in the system for a specific event

Approval Request- Creates an approval request which is used in the Ministry class.

PART B
Part B is mainly structured around creating an interface for the project where the user has the ability to input their own data 

PART C

Part C of the project was geared towards creating a GUI for the management of  venues and promoters where the user had the ability to
manipulate this data.
